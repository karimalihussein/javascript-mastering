# What is Javascript?

- Javascript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is a scripting language that is used to create and control dynamic website content, i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page.

- Javascript is a client-side programming language, which means it runs on your computer, in your browser. This is different from server-side languages like PHP, which run on the server.

- JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at
  runtime. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any
  machine (“host environment”)

- JavaScript was created to make webpages more dynamic (e.g. change content on a
  page directly from inside the browser). Originally, it was called LiveScript but due to
  the popularity of Java, it was renamed to JavaScript.

- JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, which means it supports different

- programming approaches. It is prototype-based, object-oriented, imperative, and functional.

- JavaScript is totally independent from Java and has nothing in common with Java!

# How is Javascript Executed?

- JavaScript is executed in two different ways:

  - Client-side JavaScript (CSJS)
  - Server-side JavaScript (SSJS)

- Client-side JavaScript (CSJS)

  - CSJS is executed by the browser (client) and is used to create dynamic webpages.
  - CSJS is embedded directly into HTML pages by using the <script> tag.
  - CSJS is executed on the client’s machine, which means that the source code is
    visible to the user and can be modified.
  - CSJS is used to validate user input, create cookies, and display dynamic content.
  - CSJS is supported by all modern browsers.

- Server-side JavaScript (SSJS)
  - SSJS is executed by the server and is used to create dynamic webpages.
  - SSJS is embedded directly into HTML pages by using the <script> tag.
  - SSJS is executed on the server, which means that the source code is not visible to
    the user and cannot be modified.
  - SSJS is used to access databases, file systems, etc.
  - SSJS is supported by Node.js.

# JavaScript Engines

- JavaScript Engines are programs that execute JavaScript code. They are found in
- Web browsers (e.g. V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, etc.)
- Node.js
- Adobe Acrobat
- MongoDB
- CouchDB
- etc.

# What is Dynamic Typing and Weak Typing Mean?

- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don’t have to specify the data type of a variable when declaring it. The data type of a variable can change during the execution of a program and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.

| Feature              | Dynamic Typed Languages                              | Weakly Typed Languages                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type Checking        | Performed at runtime                                 | Performed at compile-time or runtime                   |
| Type Flexibility     | Variables can change types during execution          | Variables can change types implicitly or explicitly    |
| Type Safety          | Potential for runtime type errors                    | Potential for implicit type conversions and errors     |
| Variable Declaration | Types can be omitted or inferred                     | Types are usually explicitly declared                  |
| Development Speed    | Faster development due to flexibility                | Slower development due to strictness                   |
| Error Detection      | Potential for late-stage errors                      | Potential for early-stage errors                       |
| Performance          | Generally slower due to runtime type checking        | Generally faster due to compile-time optimizations     |
| Code Readability     | May be less readable without explicit types          | May be more readable with explicit type annotations    |
| Interoperability     | Can easily integrate with external libraries         | May require explicit type conversions or wrappers      |
| Debugging            | May require more effort to trace type-related issues | May have clearer error messages related to type issues |
| Popular Examples     | JavaScript, Python, Ruby                             | C, C++, PHP                                            |


# a Brief Overview of The JavaScript History

- JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. The name was changed to JavaScript because Netscape and Sun Microsystems wanted to take advantage of the popularity of Java.

|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1995       | JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications. Initially called LiveScript, it was designed as a scripting language for web browsers.                                                           |
| 1996       | JavaScript was renamed to JavaScript 1.0 and submitted to Ecma International for standardization,                                                                                                                   |
| 1996 (late)| ECMAScript 1, based on JavaScript 1.1, was released as the first official standard for the language.                                                                                                                |
| 1997 - 2005| Several versions of ECMAScript were released during this period, including ECMAScript 2 (1997), ECMAScript 3 (1999), and ECMAScript 4 (abandoned). These versions introduced various new features and improvements. |
| 2006       | ECMAScript 3.1, also known as ECMAScript 5, was released. It brought significant enhancements to the language, including strict mode, JSON support, and new array methods.                                          |
| 2011       | ECMAScript 5.1 was released as a minor update to ECMAScript 5. It fixed some inconsistencies and improved the specification.                                                                                        |
