# What is Javascript?

- Javascript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. It is a scripting language that is used to create and control dynamic website content, i.e. anything that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page.

- Javascript is a client-side programming language, which means it runs on your computer, in your browser. This is different from server-side languages like PHP, which run on the server.

- JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at
  runtime. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any
  machine (“host environment”)

- JavaScript was created to make webpages more dynamic (e.g. change content on a
  page directly from inside the browser). Originally, it was called LiveScript but due to
  the popularity of Java, it was renamed to JavaScript.

- JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, which means it supports different

- programming approaches. It is prototype-based, object-oriented, imperative, and functional.

- JavaScript is totally independent from Java and has nothing in common with Java!

# How is Javascript Executed?

- JavaScript is executed in two different ways:

  - Client-side JavaScript (CSJS)
  - Server-side JavaScript (SSJS)

- Client-side JavaScript (CSJS)

  - CSJS is executed by the browser (client) and is used to create dynamic webpages.
  - CSJS is embedded directly into HTML pages by using the <script> tag.
  - CSJS is executed on the client’s machine, which means that the source code is
    visible to the user and can be modified.
  - CSJS is used to validate user input, create cookies, and display dynamic content.
  - CSJS is supported by all modern browsers.

- Server-side JavaScript (SSJS)
  - SSJS is executed by the server and is used to create dynamic webpages.
  - SSJS is embedded directly into HTML pages by using the <script> tag.
  - SSJS is executed on the server, which means that the source code is not visible to
    the user and cannot be modified.
  - SSJS is used to access databases, file systems, etc.
  - SSJS is supported by Node.js.

# JavaScript Engines

- JavaScript Engines are programs that execute JavaScript code. They are found in
- Web browsers (e.g. V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, etc.)
- Node.js
- Adobe Acrobat
- MongoDB
- CouchDB
- etc.

# What is Dynamic Typing and Weak Typing Mean?

- JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don’t have to specify the data type of a variable when declaring it. The data type of a variable can change during the execution of a program and JavaScript takes care of it automatically.

| Feature              | Dynamic Typed Languages                              | Weakly Typed Languages                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type Checking        | Performed at runtime                                 | Performed at compile-time or runtime                   |
| Type Flexibility     | Variables can change types during execution          | Variables can change types implicitly or explicitly    |
| Type Safety          | Potential for runtime type errors                    | Potential for implicit type conversions and errors     |
| Variable Declaration | Types can be omitted or inferred                     | Types are usually explicitly declared                  |
| Development Speed    | Faster development due to flexibility                | Slower development due to strictness                   |
| Error Detection      | Potential for late-stage errors                      | Potential for early-stage errors                       |
| Performance          | Generally slower due to runtime type checking        | Generally faster due to compile-time optimizations     |
| Code Readability     | May be less readable without explicit types          | May be more readable with explicit type annotations    |
| Interoperability     | Can easily integrate with external libraries         | May require explicit type conversions or wrappers      |
| Debugging            | May require more effort to trace type-related issues | May have clearer error messages related to type issues |
| Popular Examples     | JavaScript, Python, Ruby                             | C, C++, PHP                                            |
